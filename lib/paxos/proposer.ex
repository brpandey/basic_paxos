defmodule Paxos.Proposer do
  @moduledoc """
  A Proposer seeks consensus in the paxos algorithm.

  In the prepare phase it selects a new distinct proposal number n and sends it
  to all acceptors with the intent of a) securing a majority of promises not to accept a proposal
  numbered less than n and b) learning the highest accepted proposal so far from the acceptors.

  In the commit/accept phase it uses the consensus value v learned from the majority of promises
  received to then issue a proposal with number n and value v (or perhaps its own if non provided)
  to all acceptors
