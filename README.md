# Basic Paxos ('single decree')

[Paxos](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf) is an algorithm to gain consensus in a distributed system.


The three roles are performed by three classes of agents: proposers, acceptors, and learners.
The learner agent has been omitted for the sake of simplicity, but a leader agent has been added.

The coordinated actions of proposers and acceptors results in 2-phases to achieve consensus: Prepare-Promise, Commit(Accept)-Accepted

Commit(Accept)-Accepted

The basic safety requirements for consensus as described in [Paxos Made Simple](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf) by Leslie Lamport 
1) Only a value that has been proposed may be chosen
2) Only a single value is chosen, and
3) A process never learns that a value has been chosen unless it actually has been

Note: Not fault tolerant yet, as the ids, highest promises or accepted values to disk are not persisted.

To play with this using iex start a few terminal windows and run these commands
```elixir
$ iex --name paxos1@127.0.0.1 -S mix
$ iex --name paxos2@127.0.0.1 -S mix
$ iex --name paxos3@127.0.0.1 -S mix

Then in one of the windows type
$ iex(paxos1@127.0.0.1)2> Leader.start("pizza2")

And you may see something like this
{:ok,
 [
   nodes: [:"paxos1@127.0.0.1", :"paxos2@127.0.0.1", :"paxos3@127.0.0.1"],
   status: :accepted,
   round: [{1576471057770255244, "paxos2@127.0.0.1"}],
   value: ["pizza2"],
   declines: []
 ]}
```

Lastly, to run tests, ensure the Erlang port mapper daemon is running

```elixir 
$ epmd -daemon 
```

(Note on 4 - The algorithmic details (abort if receive a single promise decline, and using >= vs == on phase 2 proposal id checks) are 
different from other resources, however the error cases were well described)

Below are some unit tests

```elixir

    test "single proposer working with set of acceptors, majority of which crash and then later self-heal", %{nodes: nodes} do
      [n1, n2, n3] = nodes

      # Partitioning n2 from n1 and n3
      Schism.partition([n2])

      # Wait for partition to occur
      Process.sleep(8_000)

      # Not enough peers for a min quorum
      assert {:error, "prepare_nodes_below_min_quorum"} = Leader.start("pizza2")

      # Reintroduce n2 back into cluster
      Schism.heal([n1, n2, n3])

      Process.sleep(8_000)

      # Verify we can achieve consensus now
      assert {:ok,
              [
                nodes: [:"paxos1@127.0.0.1", :"paxos2@127.0.0.1",
                        :"paxos3@127.0.0.1"],
                status: :accepted,
                round: [{_uid, "paxos2@127.0.0.1"}],
                value: ["pizza2"],
                declines: []
              ]}
      = Leader.start("pizza2")
    end


  # Illustrate the algorithm under dueling proposers who are able to cut the other off from a commit/accept
  # based on whether that proposer was able to get promises and the initial majority of accepts

  # By tweaking the start times of the proposers we can create these conditions
  # Below we are using 3 nodes (which is the minimum quorum) to Proposer values:
